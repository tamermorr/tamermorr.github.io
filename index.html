                Consider an enormous computational task carried across multiple generations
                (e.g the mathematical corpus produced by humanity or, simply, a ledger of some blockchain).
                Is it possible to quickly<span id="dots-mrr2">... </span><span id="more-mrr2" class="more"> verify that the current generation’s computation state is correct?
                Using a probabilistically checkable proof (PCP), it is possible to encode computations so that
                at any later point one can quickly verify their correctness. In traditional PCPs, however, adding
                a new step in the computation requires regenerating the encoding from scratch. We introduce <i>tree PCPs</i>:
                these are PCPs that can be incrementally generated, one step at a time, and quickly verified at any point along the way.

                many important metrics, making them a great candidate for potential practical solutions. The security

                the existence of further heirarchy inside Microcrypt. In particular, we show that average-case problems, with quantum instance and classical solution, become easier in some sense when
