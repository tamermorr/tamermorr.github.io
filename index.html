                Private information retrieval (PIR) is a protocol for accessing a remote database
                without revealing the locations that are accessed, even to the server holding the database.
                We introduce a new family of PIR<span id="dots-cimr">... </span><span id="more-cimr" class="more">
                protocols in a model where the client is allowed to
                pre-process the database and use a secret key to access it privately. We obtain protocols that
                are extremely efficient, approaching the efficiency of trivial (non-private) database access in
                many important metrics, making them a great candidate for potential practical solutions. The security
                of our protocols is based on a family of intriguing hard problems which we call <i>learning subspace with noise (LSN)</i>,
                that involve learning a hidden linear code given noisy random codewords.

                has been troubling researchers in the field. Although many candidates have been proposed, a definite answer is still out of reach, and the relation between the various contenders is unclear.
                 In this work, we shed light on the relation between two of the more prominent candidates: OWSGs and QEFIDs, suggesting
                the existence of further heirarchy inside Microcrypt. In particular, we show that average-case problems, with quantum instance and classical solution, become easier in some sense when
                the solution is efficiently verifiable.
